# Course Syllabus

## Welcome

Welcome to Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming, the School of Computing, and the University of Utah. In this course, you will learn how to write computer programs using Java. This will involve mastering program specification, design, implementation, and testing. By the end of this course, you will be able to start with a problem statement and then design, implement, document, and test an object-oriented program that solves the problem. Along the way you will learn how to think like a computer scientist, and you will learn a number of key ideas from computer science.

The course staff (faculty and the teaching assistants) are all eager to help you succeed. However, success in programming comes from time, determination, and care. Expect to be challenged and work hard!

**Instructors:** David E. Johnson and Scott Brown

**Email:** dejohnso@cs.utah.edu

**Office:** 3146 MEB (along the west face of the MEB 3rd floor).

**Textbook:** A free interactive ebook from Runestone Academy will be used. Please see the page under Course Resources for creating an account on our course ebook.

**Clicker or audience response device:** Class quizzes through kahoot.it. A device with Internet access is needed during the class recitations. I have a small number of devices that can be checked out for the in-person recitation.

**Description:** CS 1410: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programing is the second course required for students intending to major in computer science or computer engineering, but for many people their first CS course. The course introduces the engineering and mathematical skills required to effectively program computers, as well as the range of issues confronted by computer scientists. A major theme of the course is the role of procedural and data abstraction in decomposing programs into manageable pieces. The course also introduces the concepts central to object-oriented programming (OOP). Students will complete extensive programming exercises that involve the application of elementary software engineering techniques.

Successful completion of CS 1030: Introduction to Computer Science (formerly CS 1400) or a passing score on the CS 1410 Proficiency test is the pre-requisite of CS 1410. Students may not take CS 1030 and CS 1410 concurrently. Calculus I is the co-requisite of CS 1410. CS 1410 is 4.0 credit hours.

**Meetings:** This course has been reorganized to balance personal safety under COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and opportunities to engage with the material, course staff, and your peers. Please read the following important information about the course structure:

  **Lectures:** Core class material will be covered in recorded video lectures. These will be broken into smaller topic videos. These videos will be posted on a weekly basis. 

  Students registering for a recitation will automatically be placed in a lecture section - CS 1410-80 or 85. Both of these lectures are combined into one Canvas course (this one) - which is listed as 1410-80. So do not be concerned if you think you are in a different lecture than 80 and see this course.

  **Recitations:** Once a week, students will meet either in person or through Zoom in a classroom setting. The class is broken into recitation sections of roughly 50 students each, meeting at different times in the week. Students in CS 1410-80 will have recitations on Thursday and students in CS 1410-85 will have recitations on Friday. The material in recitations will be different from lecture videos or labs. The recitations will provide opportunities to work through more complex material, to work through problems as a group, and to review past assignment submissions. Participation points are used to track attendance at recitations.

  Some recitations are in-person and some are through Zoom. The recitation/lab section you registered for determines this. If your recitation/lab only shows Canvas for a location, it is remote, otherwise the listed classroom is the in-person location. Based on this, the breakdown of recitations is 


Section	Time	Location
81	Thursday 12:55pm	WEB L104
82	Thursday 2:00pm	WEB L104
83	Thursday 3:05pm	WEB L104
84	Thursday 9:40am	Zoom
86	Friday 11:50am	WEB L104
87	Friday 12:55pm	WEB L104
88	Friday 2:00pm	WEB L104
89	Friday 9:40am	Zoom

  **Lab sessions:** Lab sections provide an opportunity for students to be guided through examples applying concepts of CS 1410. The recitation section you are enrolled in is matched with a lab section at the same time but different day. Students with a Thursday recitation will have a Tuesday lab and students with a Friday recitation will have a Wednesday lab. Labs will be conducted remotely through Zoom meetings. Lab attendance is required. 

  **Remote Weeks:** The University has designated that the weeks of September 28- October 2, October 5-10, and November 30-December 3 will be all done remotely. This means that the in-person recitations will meet over Zoom those weeks, but the course will still have scheduled activities. 

**Laptop Policy:** The School of Computing Laptop Policy (Links to an external site.) expects students taking CS 1410 to have a laptop. This policy was originally put in place to support labs and general work on assignments. With the blend of in-person and remote work for this course, access to a computing device remains critical.  Please contact the course instructor if you are having trouble meeting this requirement.

**Course Materials** 

**Website** The class website is the Canvas course available through CIS. It will be updated throughout the semester with the class schedule, lecture notes and videos, laboratory exercises, assignment specifications, and much more. 

**Lecture notes** The instructor will often make use of slides and other documents during lecture. These documents will be posted on the class website along with the video lecture; however, such posted documents may not represent completely the material covered in class. Students are strongly encouraged to stay current with posted materials.

**Java and Eclipse** All programming in CS 1410 is in Java, using the Eclipse programming environment. Eclipse is available for your use on the College of Engineering’s Windows computers (WEB 210) and Linux computers (WEB 224) and through the CADE remote desktop. Both Java and Eclipse are platform-independent. Instructions for installing both on your personal computer are available on the class website under the Course Resources module.

*New students should create a College of Engineering lab account at: https://webhandin.eng.utah.edu/cade/create_account/index.php*

### Student Evaluation
**Programming assignments** The instructions for each assignment and its due date will be posted on the class website. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure the successful and timely submission of each programming assignment — start early and follow the instructions carefully. Corrupted or missing files will not be grounds for extensions. Double-check your submissions, and save a digital copy of all of your work. Many assignments will be submitted through the Gradescope system, which provides some basic checking and testing. Students should review the results of this testing and use it to make sure the assignment is submitted properly.

**Participation**

There are multiple activities that will ask you reflect on your understanding of material, to evaluate others' work, and to evaluate your own work. While these will typically be assessed as participation rather than a detailed score, these activities are critical to your development as a computer scientist and will require time each week to complete.

*Peer Review* Students will use an online system to comment on peers' submitted assignments. This activity helps you think in a critical way about your own work and adds additional useful feedback to students to what the course staff provides. 

*Kahoot Quizzes* and Runestone Ebook Other participation points come from in-class Kahoot quizzes and the Runestone electronic textbook (see other parts of the syllabus for details). In general, the scores from these activities will be converted into a participation style credit and some scores dropped.

**Late Assignments** Assignments turned in after the due date and time receive an immediate 10% score deduction. After 24 hours, the score becomes 0% and a likely candidate for the one dropped assignment grade discussed below. In general, you should use the dropped score as the way this course handles the problems we all face during the semester rather than asking for instructor consent for late work. Longer term issues should be discussed with the instructor - we are not trying to fail students! 

**Lab exercises** Every Tuesday, students complete a lab exercise reviewing the material covered recently in lecture or preparing for an upcoming assignment. Often, a quiz or worksheet accompanies the lab exercise and is due at the end of the designated lab period. No lab exercise / worksheet may be made up for credit, except in the case of a documented emergency. Two lab scores will be automatically dropped to allow for issues you may have in attending the labs. To handle small issues, you can attend a different lab section than the one you are registered for, but this should not be a long-term practice.

**Tests and final exam** Testing will consist of two mid-terms given during the recitations on Sept. 24th and 25th and the recitation sections on October 29th and 30th (this has been changed from the original dates). The final exam is cumulative and will take place Tuesday, December 8th from 1pm - 3pm. The exact form of the exam is to be determined, but will likely have an online component. No test may be taken at a different time for any reason other than a documented medical emergency or official University of Utah excused activities.

**Final course grade** The weighting for the final grade is:

Weekly Assignments 60%
Mid-Term Tests 14% 
Final Exam 13% 
Labs 8% 
Participation 5%.

Your weighted, cumulative course percentage score is turned into letter grades using the following scheme:

[100-94] A, (94-90] A-, (90-87] B+, (87-84] B, (84-80] B-, (80-77] C+, (77-74] C, (74-70] C-, (70-67] D+, (67-64] D, (64-60] D-, (60-0] E

where [ ] means including that number and ( ) means up to but not including. 

**Regrades** Students who wish to appeal a score on an assignment, a lab, a quiz, or a test must do so within one week of receiving the score. See information under Course Resources for the regrade process.

**Dropped scores** Students may end up missing a deadline, a lecture, or a lab session for a reason that is not granted an exception. Therefore, to allow for such an occurrence, various activities allow dropped scores:

1. The lowest score earned on an assignment is dropped (the final project cannot be dropped).
2. The lowest two scores on lab exercises are dropped. Tests are not considered to be lab exercises.
3. Some number of Kahoot participation, ebook exercises, and peer review scores will be dropped, in combination with score adjustments for participation credit. I need to see how many of these get assigned, but the drops will be in the general spirit of the other components.
4. No test or final exam scores are dropped.

### Getting Help
**Instructor office hours** See the link at the top of the course website under Course Resources. 

**Teaching assistants and consulting hours** See the link at the top of the course website under Course Resources for the consulting schedule of the course TAs. During consultation, use the TA Queue (also on the class website) to alert the TA on duty that you have a question. TA hours are normally held in the CADE lab, but this semester will be held over Zoom meetings. Please see the link for more information.

**Communication** For questions outside of class and consulting hours, students are encouraged to use Piazza. Please see how to contact course staff under the Course Resources module. 

To send urgent messages to everyone in the class, such as corrections to assignments or changes in due dates, the course staff will make use of Piazza. Students are expected to check their email and the class website regularly. 

To ask a question of the course staff, students should use Piazza, which is linked in the menu bar on the left of the course Canvas page.

In general, we can often provide quick and detailed responses through Piazza and it is an excellent mechanism for getting feedback. See further instructions under the "Resources" module in Canvas.

### Advice for Success in CS 1410
For most of you, this will be your first or second class in computer science. Here is some advice on how to approach this class such that you will have the best chance for success.

- Concentrate in lecture and recitations. The concepts that are presented in lecture and recitations are what are important; you will be able to find the details in the assigned reading. If you write down everything that is said and then try to figure it out later, you are wasting your time coming to lecture. Instead, think about what is being said. Try to answer all the questions that are asked, even if only in your head. Think about why material is being presented - if you do not see the connection to past materials or assignments, ask for help.
- Participate in the lab sections. You will be working at a computer in a (virtual) room with at least one teaching assistant and a small number of other students. Take advantage of the computer by trying things out. That way, you will discover the things that you do not understand in a setting where there are plenty of other people (TAs, as well as students) to help you.
- Respect the assignments. Some students expect that if they have done the reading, concentrated in lecture, and participated in the labs, then the assignments will be straightforward. What these students do not understand is that the assignments are designed to challenge you by requiring that you apply the concepts you have learned to new situations. The assignments will be your most important learning experience in the course; they will rarely be straightforward. You should start each assignment as soon as the specifications are posted. This way, you will have time to take a break when you get stuck.

Beginners are often surprised by the amount of human effort that must go into designing, writing, and testing a program. Complaints from students about the amount of time required by introductory computer programming courses are universal. You should expect to spend three hours outside of class for every hour that you spend in class. In other words, you should expect to spend twelve hours per week reading, studying, and designing and writing programs. Some of you will spend less, but many of you will spend even more time. Please keep this in mind when setting up your schedule for the semester!

### Course Guidelines 
**School of Computing Policies**

Please read through the SoC undergraduate handbook: 

https://handbook.cs.utah.edu

College of Engineering Policies

Please read through the CoE policies on appeals, adds/drops, etc:

https://www.coe.utah.edu/students/current/semester-guidelines/

**Behavior in the classroom** All students are expected to maintain professional behavior, according to www.regulations.utah.edu/academics/guides/students/studentRights.html (the University of Utah Student Code). Students should read the Code carefully and know that they are responsible for the content. 

Students are expected to engage with the instructor and classmates during class meetings. Students are permitted to use a laptop or mobile device to take notes. Use of a laptop or mobile device for any other purpose is not permitted, and students who do so will be asked to leave the classroom. While you may consider it a right to casually browse the web, engage in social media, or play games during lecture, such activity is very distracting to others (especially in a crowded classroom) and is not permitted.

**Masks:** Based on CDC guidelines, the University requires everyone to wear face coverings in shared public spaces on campus, including our classroom. As a reminder, when I wear a face covering, I am protecting you. When you wear a face covering, you are protecting me and all of your classmates. If you forget your face covering, I will ask you to leave class to retrieve it. If you repeatedly fail to wear a face covering in class, I will refer you to the Dean of Students for a possible violation of the Student Code. Note that some students may qualify for accommodations through the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). If you think you meet these criteria and desire an exception to the face covering policy, contact the Center for Disability and Access (Links to an external site.) (CDA). Accommodations should be obtained prior to the first day of class so that I am notified by CDA of any students who are not required to wear a face covering.

**Extended Illness or Quarantine:** If you have a period of extended illness, you should work with the course instructor to keep you on a path for success for the semester. Please discuss your situation as soon as possible with the course instructor. You should take advantage of the remote sections of recitations where possible. 

**Working together** Students are encouraged to discuss assignments and laboratory exercises with fellow classmates, but each student is responsible for formulating and writing their own answer. Cheating is: sharing written or electronic work either by copying, retyping, looking at, or supplying a copy. Cheating is not: discussing concepts, answering questions about concepts or clarifying ambiguities, or helping someone understand how to use the class tools and software. Looking at a fellow student's code or having another student look at your code is always considered academic misconduct.

Students may occasionally be required to work on assignments or lab exercises in pairs. Guidelines and rules for working together will be posted with such assignments. There are two exemptions to the working together policy - students may always work on the online ebook exercises together and you may always discuss in-class interactive audience response questions with classmates.

Cheating is taken very seriously and students must be careful not to collaborate on assignments. 

Submissions are routinely checked by the course staff for signs of unauthorized collaboration. 

There must be no collaboration during tests or the final exam. Please see the University of Utah Student Code for a detailed description of the university policy on cheating.

**Any student found cheating will fail the entire course.**

**Additional Resources**

Student Success The University of Utah has a number of offices to help you be successful. Please look over this collection of resources: https://studentsuccess.utah.edu/resources/student-support/

Students with disabilities The University of Utah seeks to provide equal access to its programs, services and activities for people with disabilities.
